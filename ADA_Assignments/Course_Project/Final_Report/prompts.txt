    - DVC: How it works in the context of this project (using the diagram used during the live presentation)
    - DVC: Implementation
        - Describe each of the point, which example screenshot from the actual Repo


- Implementation details
    - Give link to Repo
    - Explain the tools and packages used
    - Also explain how this could be deployed (Eg: As a Webapp)

- Conclusion
    - Describe the key takeways from the project (regarding MLOps and DVC as a data versioning tool)
    - Describe what we learn from the project and insights gained solving the demo problem

    - Give the references to the relevant litaratures used
"
Given the above blueprint, write the “Conclusion” section for the report. Make sure to include the following details:
"
- Describe the key takeways from the project (regarding MLOps and DVC as a data versioning tool)
- Describe what we learn from the project and insights gained solving the demo problem
- Describe the challenges faced by us during the course project regarding data version management
- Describe how working on a course project in team and exploring various resources realted topic was a good learning experience
"




# PROMPTS:

# Research Questions

Given the above blueprint, write the “Research Question” section for the report. Use the following three questions as the basis:
- What is the current state of data versioning in the marketplace?
- What are the requirements that need to be considered when considering applying data versioning into the project pipeline?
- What kind of approaches or frameworks can be used for building an integrated ML system and to continuously operate it in production?

# Data Versioning Tool: DVC

Given the above blueprint, write the “Data Versioning Tool: DVC” section for the report. Also include the following details:

"
DVC is an Open-source, Git-based data science library, developed by iterative.ai, which enables users to apply version control to machine development by tracking ML Models and Data sets.

It provides 3 main functions:

- ML Project Version Control:
This allows to version control ML Models, datasets and intermediate files.
DVC connects them with code, and supports state of the art frameworks like Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage etc to store the file contents.

Full code and data provenance help track the complete evolution of every ML model. This guarantees reproducibility and makes it easy to switch back and forth between experiments.

- ML Experiment Management:
This also allows to harness the full power of Git branches to try different ideas instead of sloppy file suffixes and comments in code. This also allow the use automatic metric-tracking to navigate instead of doing it manually.

- Deployment and Collaboration:
This also simplifies collaboration by the use of push/pull commands to move consistent bundles of ML models, data, and code into production to remote machines or a colleague's computer instead of relying on ad-hock scripts, which could very well go wrong and make it harder to diagnose bugs.


- DVC Implementation
Given the above blueprint, write the “Demo Problem” section for the report, describing the problem. Here is the desription of the demo problem to be discussed in the report:
"
Title: Changing dataset by Modifying Random Seed
- Create a simple classification model using a random seed for train-test split
- Modify the random seed and observe the impact on model performance
- Track changes to the dataset and model using DVC and Git
"

Also include how, this demo problem is helpful in understanding the "DVC" Tool for Data Versioning and also the Research Questions posed at the beginning.
