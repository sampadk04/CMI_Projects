I have a Fabric Link dataset. It has 4 columns named 'source_node', 'destination_node', 'Utilization', 'datetime'.

'source_node': contains integers representing source nodes
'destination_node': contains integers representing source nodes
'Utilization': total utilization of bandwidth
'datetime': contains the date and time stamp of the time of recording

The plan is to find all the possible unique ('source_node',  'destination_node') pairs (also called links) and for each ('source_node',  'destination_node') pair (or link), filter out the 'Utilization', 'datetime' columns. Then do further analysis.

The target variable of interest is 'Utilization'.

What are the things I can do for Exploratory Data Analysis?

List ways to find groups of ('source_node',  'destination_node') pairs or links, which are similar to each other in terms of 'Utilization' over time.



# Things to try

- ('source_node',  'destination_node') pairwise analysis.
- Find the pairs with the following property:
    - Maximum average 'Utilization'
    - Minimum average 'Utilization'
    - Average 'Utilization'

- Try getting a table consisting of 'source_node' on horizontal and 'destination_node' on vertical and corresponding average 'Utilization' colour-coded based on value.

# Finding the links which are similar to each other.
- Method 1:
    - Think of each link to be a 'd' dimensional vector storing the 'Utilization' value over 'd' days.
    - Use some similarity or clustering technique to find cluster of similar groups.
    - Use tsne plot and show these clusters.
    - One possible way to choose the clusters is by deciding the no. of example plots to consider and divide accordingly.
- Method 2:
    - Think of each link as a distribution of 'Utilization' values.
    - Use some technique to identify groups of links with similar distribution: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test

# Weekday and Weekend patterns (should be clear from the analysis of corresponding strip plots from the plots selecting above)
- Plot strip-plots of 'Utilization' and mean 'Utilization' w.r.t. days of week and months of year

# What the inferences that you can draw from the above plots?
Select some plots and use the help of ChatGPT to create some cool inferences.

# How are the bandwidth Utilizations?
- Plot the histogram or distribution plot of 'Utilization'
Make inferences based on this
- Also try grouping the Utilization based on dates and plot the strip-plots of bandwidth utilization on that particular day and also connect the mean bandwidth utilization.
